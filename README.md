  - To update a specific package to its latest version: `poetry update <package-name>`

## Usage
1. Create a virtual environment (if not using Poetry): `python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Run the application: `python main.py` --> It will default to loading the `prod.env`
   - Run your script with desired stage: `python main.py --stage dev`
3. Notes:
- Run the Application as production:
  - Execute permissions: `chmod +x start_app.sh`
  - Run the application as background: `./start_app.sh`
  - Check the application is running: `ps -p $(cat outfit-square.pid)`
    - Display live view of process's resource usage
      - `top -p $(cat outfit-square.pid)`
    - Display the CPU and memory usage:
      - `ps -p $(cat outfit-square.pid) -o %cpu,%mem,cmd`
      - If the %CPU is over 100% that are running on multiple cores.
- Remember to replace `DISCORD_TOKEN`, and `MONGO_URI` with the actual environment variable names in `.env` files.
